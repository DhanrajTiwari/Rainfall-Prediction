## Rainfall Prediction

Rainfall Prediction Using Classification Algorithm.

This dataset is real-time data in which I used data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Logistic Regression Algorithm.

## **In-depth Intuition of model preparation**

* In data preprocessing I dropped some columns which are not required for the model implementation and also did renaming of some columns for better understanding. After that, I used the Aggregate function here to calculate the best values which are good for my model.

* Used Barplot to check the relation between the dataset, and also used distplot to check whether data is normally distributed or skewed.

* And at last main model comes into the picture which is used to check whether the dataset I had built is working well or not by using Logistic Regression. Accuracy_score using Logistic Regression is coming to 90%.

*  While using some metrics of classification like precision, recall, and F1 score my model is working well.
